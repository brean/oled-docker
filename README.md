# Docker OLED Display setup
Docker ROS 2 humble environment for your Rasbperry PI to show some information that are interesting in robotics.
You can configure it to show different values, the default is:

 - WiFi IP-Address (using `psutil`)
 - Temperature (using the python bindings for `vcgencmd` for [raspberry pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html))
 - Battery (read from the ROS 2-topic `battery_state`)
 - WiFi signal strength (by simply parsing `/proc/net/wireless`)
 - An overview as icons/emojis showing if any of the following problems occured:
    - ⚡ for undervoltage
    - ☹️ for CPU throtteling
    - **F** for CPU **F**requency cap
    - T for CPU soft **T**emperature limit
  
   followed by the same icons to show if any of these problems happending right now (If everything is fine you should see 4 dashes followed by a vertical line follwed by 4 additional dashes `----|----` - based on [`vcgencmd`](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/os.html#get_throttled)).
 - The systems ROS_DOMAIN_ID next to the overview (you should configure the docker-compose file to forward this to your docker container)

## Installation
Just copy the docker-compose.yml to your robot, write your own or checkout the whole repository then run `docker compose up -d` and wait until the docker images are downloaded, 1-2 minutes later the information should show up on the connected screen.
If the docker deamon is setup to auto-start (for example via systemctl/systemd) the docker container will automatically start every time you start the raspberry pi.
